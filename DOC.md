#### OpenFace Installation
Installed OpenFace on Windows using [Windows Installation](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki/Windows-Installation). Checked computing using Windows Powershell (32 bit). Used Windows Powershell and command lines available at [OpenFace Command Lines](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki/Command-line-arguments) to test installation.
Note that videos must be in mp4 format to run through OpenFace application. The following command lines were used to run sequence analysis (locate facial points) on a video with one person (command line argument: ```FaceLandmarkVid```): 

```
// Locate OpenFace Directory
cd "C:\Users\cchao2869\Desktop\OpenFace_2.2.0_win_x86\OpenFace_2.2.0_win_x86"

// Places landmarks on the video for Facial Recognition (FR) 
.\FaceLandmarkVid.exe -f "C:\Users\cchao2869\Desktop\OpenFace_2.2.0_win_x86\OpenFace_2.2.0_win_x86\example_video.mp4" -out_dir "C:\Users\cchao2869\Desktop\OpenFace_2.2.0_win_x86\output"

```

This resulted in an avi file with the designed FR points, and a large data table.

An additional test was performed using multiple faces. The following command line was implented: 

```
// Places landmarks on the video for multiple faces
.\FaceLandmarkVidMulti.exe -f "C:\Users\cchao2869\Desktop\OpenFace_2.2.0_win_x86\OpenFace_2.2.0_win_x86\example_video3.mp4" -out_dir "C:\Users\cchao2869\Desktop\OpenFace_2.2.0_win_x86\output"
```
