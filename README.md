## Research 
Our first step was to comprehend the steps and process of facial recognition. We used the website [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@Coursesteach/building-a-real-time-emotion-detection-with-python-7fe6090a125d) to break down the process of facial recognition into manageable chunks. 
These are the steps we broke down the process into:
### 1. Data Collection and Prep
  * **Dataset:** A collection of photos assigned with different emotions to train the model on what the emotions look like.

  * **Preprocessing:** The process of resizing, scaling pixels, and augmentation for diversity (diverse images broaden capabilities of emotion detection so it detects more than a certain group of people Ex. All male images = only accurate for males)
