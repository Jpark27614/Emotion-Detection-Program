Our first step was to comprehend the steps and process of facial recognition. We used the website [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@Coursesteach/building-a-real-time-emotion-detection-with-python-7fe6090a125d) to break down the process of facial recognition into manageable chunks. 
These are the steps we broke down the process into:
* Data Collection and Prep
  * Dataset: A collection of photos assigned with different emotions to train the model on what the emotions look like.
